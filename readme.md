## Rails' Asset Pipeline

### Intro

* Assets are CSS, JS, image files
* Asset pipeline gives you precompilation, concatenation, and minification of assets in a centralized way
* The asset pipeline compiles Sass, CoffeeScript, etc to CSS, JS
* (Sprockets gem)[https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets] packages the assets for you
* It's all enabled by defaultand set up for you out of the box with Rails

### Where does all this happen
* `app/assets`
* `lib/assets`
* `vendor/assets`
* `public/assets`
